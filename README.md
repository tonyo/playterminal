# playterminal

PlayTerminal is an attempt to bring old-school console gaming back to life. The idea is to create a library of games you can play in a terminal and give an opportunity to run them, ehmm, without a terminal, i.e. right in your browser.

Deployed instance: https://playtermin.al

Repository with games (Docker images): https://github.com/rev112/playterminal-images
